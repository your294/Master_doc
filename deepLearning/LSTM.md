## if the return_sequences is True
If the return_sequences parameter of an LSTM layer is set to True, the layer will return the full sequence of outputs for each time step in the input sequence, rather than just the output for the last time step. This means that if your input sequence has t time steps, the LSTM layer will produce an output sequence of the same length t.
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define an input sequence with 5 time steps and 3 features at each time step
input_sequence = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                               [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                               [7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
                               [10.0, 11.0, 12.0],
                               [13.0, 14.0, 15.0]]])

# Create an LSTM layer with return_sequences=True
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)

# Apply the LSTM layer to the input sequence
output_sequence = lstm_layer(input_sequence)

# The output_sequence will contain the LSTM's output for each time step
print(output_sequence.shape)

```

In this example, output_sequence will have the shape (1, 5, 64) because the LSTM layer returns a sequence of outputs for each of the 5 time steps, and each output has a dimension of 64.

Setting return_sequences=True is useful in situations where you need to access information from all time steps in the sequence, such as in sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation or when stacking multiple recurrent layers on top of each other. However, if your ultimate goal is to make a single prediction for the entire sequence (e.g., sentiment analysis on a sentence), you may set return_sequences=False to obtain only the final output of the LSTM layer, which has a shape of (batch_size, units) and can be used as input to subsequent layers like Dense layers for the final prediction.

## if the return_state is True it will return 3 res
When you set return_state=True in tf.keras.layers.LSTM, the layer will return not only the output sequence but also the hidden state and cell state of the LSTM cells. This can be useful in various situations, such as when you want to initialize the state of the LSTM layer or when you're building more complex recurrent neural network architectures.

Here's how you can use return_state=True:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define an input sequence with 5 time steps and 3 features at each time step
input_sequence = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                               [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                               [7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
                               [10.0, 11.0, 12.0],
                               [13.0, 14.0, 15.0]]])

# Create an LSTM layer with return_state=True
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_state=True)

# Apply the LSTM layer to the input sequence
output_sequence, hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_layer(input_sequence)

# The output_sequence will contain the LSTM's output for each time step
# The hidden_state and cell_state will contain the final hidden state and cell state of the LSTM cells
print(output_sequence.shape)
print(hidden_state.shape)
print(cell_state.shape)

```

In this example, output_sequence will have the shape (1, 5, 64) as it contains the output sequence for each time step. hidden_state and cell_state will have the shape (1, 64) and represent the final hidden state and cell state of the LSTM cells, respectively.

You might use the hidden state and cell state in various ways, such as initializing the state of subsequent LSTM layers or using them in custom calculations or layers within your neural network. This can be particularly useful when building more complex recurrent neural network architectures like encoder-decoder models in machine translation or sequence generation tasks.
